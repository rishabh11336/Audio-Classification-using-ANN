# Audio Classification using ANN (Artificial Neural Network) with TensorFlow

## Project Overview

This repository contains code for a simple audio classification project using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) implemented with TensorFlow. The model achieves 81% accuracy on the dataset downloaded from [UrbanAudio8K](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html).

## Installation

Provide instructions on how to install any dependencies and set up the project environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Explain how to use your project, including any configuration needed, how to train the model, and how to test it. Provide examples of commands or scripts to run.

```bash
python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
python test.py --model_path /path/to/saved_model
```

## Dataset

Provide information about the dataset used. Include details like its source (UrbanAudio8K.org), how to download it, and any preprocessing steps applied.

## Model Architecture

Describe the architecture of your neural network model briefly. Include relevant details such as the number of layers, activation functions used, and any other significant design choices.

## Results

Discuss the results of your model, including metrics like accuracy, loss curves, and any insights gained from the evaluation.

## Future Work
